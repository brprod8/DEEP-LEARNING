`DEEP-LEARNING` *team has asked you to help them create a `model`that **predicts** whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup*.
*The business team has given you a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of `machine learning` and **neural networks**, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business*.
